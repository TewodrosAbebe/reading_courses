                   Meaning: A Survey},
  volume =        {6},
  year =          {2012},
  abstract =      {Distributional models represent a word through the
                   contexts in which it has been observed. They can be
                   used to predict similarity in meaning, based on the
                   distributional hypothesis, which states that two
                   words that occur in similar contexts tend to have
                   similar meanings. Distributional approaches are often
                   implemented in vector space models. They represent a
                   word as a point in high-dimensional space, where each
                   dimension stands for a context item, and a word's
                   coordinates represent its context counts. Occurrence
                   in similar contexts then means proximity in space. In
                   this survey we look at the use of vector space models
                   to describe the meaning of words and phrases: the
                   phenomena that vector space models address, and the
                   techniques that they use to do so. Many word meaning
                   phenomena can be described in terms of semantic
                   similarity: synonymy, priming, categorization, and
                   the typicality of a predicate's arguments. But vector
                   space models can do more than just predict semantic
                   similarity. They are a very flexible tool, because
                   they can make use of all of linear algebra, with all
                   its data structures and operations. The dimensions of
                   a vector space can stand for many things: context
                   words, or non-linguistic context like images, or
                   properties of a concept. And vector space models can
                   use matrices or higher-order arrays instead of
                   vectors for representing more complex relationships.
                   Polysemy is a tough problem for distributional
                   approaches, as a representation that is learned from
                   all of a word's contexts will conflate the different
                   senses of the word. It can be addressed, using either
                   clustering or vector combination techniques. Finally,
                   we look at vector space models for phrases, which are
                   usually constructed by combining word vectors. Vector
                   space models for phrases can predict phrase
                   similarity, and some argue that they can form the
                   basis for a general-purpose representation framework
                   for natural language semantics.},
